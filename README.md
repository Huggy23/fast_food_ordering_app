# fast_food_ordering_app

I created this app as for a school project. It is just beginner Java. I used Eclipse to create this code.

This app is for an online order. The user requests whether they want delivery or pick-up. If the user wants delivery, the app asks the user for their zipcode to verify delivery range. Then the customer adds food items to their order. The app then calculates the delivery estimate time and the total cost with tax and delivery fees.
